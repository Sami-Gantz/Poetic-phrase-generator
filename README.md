Scrimba helped me get the hang of Javascript in this simple program.
I loved discovering how some (if not all) if the functions are outsourced such as the AI generated text and background.
I deleted the original avatar.jpg which existed in the original code. I struggled to download a viable avatar on my work thin client so left it without one.
The knock-on effect was pleasantly surprising: with the additonal space in the browser now freed up by the lack of centrally located avatar I got a much lengthier text block.

Thanks Scrimba
